WHY?

Functional chatbot? Goal-oriented chatbot? Virtual assistant? Voice bot (Siri, Google Assistant)?

Chatbots or voice bots thare are out there lack the ability to remember and converse like a real human being (or a friend).

By combining all the properties of a chatbot, voicebot and virtual assistant, we can create a bot that functions more similarly to a human.

It is like having a friend that will help you with basic questions, a friend that will support and make conversation, and also a virtual assistant that can help operate your computer.

Eventually, if we can add sentiments towards the bot, that would be greater! (humanized)
